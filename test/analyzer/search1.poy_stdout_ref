beginning of the program
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
read an input file

transform some characters
transform some characters
set the cost calculation to iterative
in parallel:

  swap the trees in memory
  
  while keeping the following invariant:
    eliminate repeated trees
    select the optimal trees
    
eliminate repeated trees
select the optimal trees

I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)

processor group 1:

  report in all_trees the trees in memory
  

processor group 2:

  report the consensus
  

processor group 3:

  report in diagnosis the diagnosis
  close POY
