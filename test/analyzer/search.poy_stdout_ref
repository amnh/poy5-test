beginning of the program
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
read an input file

read an input file
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
change my log file
change the root

I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)

processor group 1:

  report the time delta
  

processor group 2:

  transform some characters
  transform some characters
  in parallel:
  
    build some trees from scratch
    swap the trees in memory
    
    while keeping the following invariant:
      eliminate repeated trees
      select the optimal trees
      
  eliminate repeated trees
  select the optimal trees
  in parallel:
  
    try to escape the local optimum
    
    while keeping the following invariant:
      eliminate repeated trees
      select the optimal trees
      
  eliminate repeated trees
  select the optimal trees
  fuse the trees I have in memory
  eliminate repeated trees
  select the optimal trees
  
  I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)
  
  processor group 1:
  
    report in all_trees the trees in memory
    
  
  processor group 2:
  
    report the consensus
    
  
  processor group 3:
  
    report in diagnosis the diagnosis
    change my log file
    
  
  processor group 4:
  
    report the time delta
