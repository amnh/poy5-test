beginning of the program
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
read an input file
transform some characters
in parallel:

  build some trees from scratch
  swap the trees in memory
  
  while keeping the following invariant:
    eliminate repeated trees
    select the optimal trees
    
eliminate repeated trees
select the optimal trees

I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)

processor group 1:

  report in genome the diagnosis
  

processor group 2:

  report the consensus
  close POY
