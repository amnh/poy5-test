beginning of the program
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
read an input file
change the root
store my state in a variable
transform some characters
in parallel:

  build some trees from scratch
  swap the trees in memory
  
  while keeping the following invariant:
    eliminate repeated trees
    select the optimal trees
    
eliminate repeated trees
select the optimal trees

I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)

processor group 1:

  report in 111.tre the trees in memory
  

processor group 2:

  report the consensus
  

processor group 3:

  report the consensus
  

processor group 4:

  use a stored state as my current state
  transform some characters
  in parallel:
  
    build some trees from scratch
    swap the trees in memory
    
    while keeping the following invariant:
      eliminate repeated trees
      select the optimal trees
      
  eliminate repeated trees
  select the optimal trees
  
  I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)
  
  processor group 1:
  
    report in 112.tre the trees in memory
    
  
  processor group 2:
  
    report the consensus
    
  
  processor group 3:
  
    report the consensus
