beginning of the program
change the random number generator's seed
change the timer interval
read an input file
change the root

I will calculate the following in separate processors (if available)

processor group 1:

  in parallel:
  
    build some trees from scratch
    swap the trees in memory
    
    while keeping the following invariant:
      eliminate repeated trees
      select the optimal trees
      
  eliminate repeated trees
  select the optimal trees
  

processor group 2:

  calculate the jackknife clades
  report the support values
  close POY
